11: Number is Palindrome or not solve it without using string 
class Solution:

            x //= 10
        
        # Even length: x == reversed_half
        # Odd length: x == reversed_half // 10
        return x == reversed_half or x == reversed_half // 10


12 : with string 
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        s = str(x)           # convert number to string
        return s == s[::-1]  # check if forward == backward
# This solution runs in O(d) time and O(d) space, where d is the number of digits. Itâ€™s simple, but not optimal in terms of space. If we want O(1) space, we need the math-based approach.
it uses extra memory (because it creates a string).
